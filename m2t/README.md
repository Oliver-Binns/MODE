##Model-to-Text Transformation

This transformation consists of
 * Model-to-Model, Y1481702 (Gathering object) to Y1481702-m2t (Report object)
 * Model-to-Text, Y1481702-m2t (Report object) to HTML Webpage

N.B. ANT Script (Y1481702.xml) must be moved into the parent directory in order to be run so that it can have to access models in the model directory.
